=== An evolving platform
. Expansive platform
. Developer friendly
. Unity for game development

=== Community
- Enterprise -> Community
- You can run C# anywhere

=== Book
. Mixed level coverage
- Books are harder to update than a language
. Noda Time https://github.com/nodatime/nodatime
. Terminology choices

== Chapter 2: C# 2

=== Generics

==== Collections before generics
- Arrays: Statically typed
- Object-based collections: Statically typed
- Specialized collections
- Need to know size before adding values

==== Generics save the day
. List<T> 
- Doesn't need to know size
- Uses t types
- Use with any element type without worrying about generating code and managing result
. Arity of Generic Types
- Declaration is the number of type parameters

==== What can be generic
- Fields
- Properties
- Indexers
- Constructors
- Events
- Finalizers

==== Type inference for type arguments to methods
- Tuples allow type inference to be used where type arguments have to be explicit
- Type inference intersects with inheritance, conversions, option params
- Sometimes it works perfectly
- Sometimes you need to create a new generic to make it work
- If it fails at compile time sometimes you can fix it with a cast
- Or explicitly tell it

==== Type constraints
- Using iformattable as the base and inherit a generic type from it?
- By using inheritance, you can make the methods on the base class useable

==== Default and typeof operators
. default = default for type
- Reference types - null reference
- non-nullable types - all zeroes (0, 0.0, false, UTF-16 numeral 0)
- Nullable value types = null
. typeOf = 
- no generics involved (typeof(string))
- generics involved but not type params (typeof(list<int>))
- type param (typeof(T)) = closed constructed type
- Type param in operand (typeof(List<TItem>))
- no type param (typeof(List<>))
- Lots of methods and properties in type
- typeof(T) has same result as typeof(string)

==== Generic type initialization and state
- If you don't have a static type constructor, there are fewer timer guarantees
- different generic types are independent on init

=== Nullable Value Types
. If null reference exceptions are bad? Why do we have more nullable value types?
. Aim: Expressing an absence of information
- Having a model that also indicates absences
- C# used decimal.MaxValue or a boolean if it needed to be absent
- And that was bad
- Now we can encapsulate to be safer on a check
. CLR and framework support: the nullable<T> struct
- Allows T to be any value type except other nullable<T>
- Implicit conversion from T to nullable<T>
- Value : value of the nullable type if it had value, and hasValue: boolean on if the value exists
- Boxed values: HasValue is false, null reference, HasValue tur - reference to object boxed T (casting value type to a type)
. Language support
- ? type suffix: makes the value type the nullable<T> struct
- Null literal: make hasValue false
- Conversions: propagate nulls appropriately is lifting
- Explicit conversions can be done no matter the type
- Lifted Operators: true and false are never lifted, only operators with non-nullable value types are lifted, unary and binary operators return type has to be non-nullable original operator, return type original operator must be bool
- & and | have other behaviors
- Operand types become their nullable equivalents
- Nullable logic: true/false/null, check the truth table on page 47
- Two null values are considered equal to each other
- AS operator and nullable value types: helps with conversion safety (but is slow)
- Null-coalescing operator ??: first ?? second
- eval first, if result non-null that's result, evaluate second and use as result

=== Simplified Delegate Creation
. Method group conversions
- Method group is implicitly convertible to a delegate type
. Anonymous methods
- lambda expressions
- Better than method group conversions for creating a delegate instance
- Delegate instance without real method
- Create delegate that calls with params
. Delegate compatibility
- I have no idea what's happening here. 
- Implicit casting between params
- Int64 -> Int32 data loss (int32 -> int64 is fine)
- Receiver type 

=== Iterators

==== Intro
- A method or property implemented with an iterator block
- Block of code using yield return
- IEnumerable / IEnumerable<T>
- IEnumerator / IEnumerator<T>
- Yield type can be provided or it's ```object```
- Allows for looping over value sets

==== Laxy Execution
- Execute code only when you need the value
- IEnumerable can iterate without changing state (book)
- IEnumerator does mutate state (bookmark)

==== Eval of yield
- Exceptions
- End of method
- Yield break
- Eval of value for return yield

==== Importance of being lazy
- ?
- If the cost of the for loop is expensive, lazy eval is much better
- Unwrapped for loops are costly 

==== Eval of finally blocks
. What happens?
- If execution is paused in a yield return, it's inside try block and doesn't execute finally
- If returns MoveNext() then exit block to the finally
. The answer is 1
. Lazy eval works
. Breaking out of the foreach loop will hit the finally block?

==== Importance of finally handling
- If you don't call dispose on an iterator it could be leaky

==== Implementation sketch
- The compiler does a lot, but iterators have been taken over by linq so I guess that's fine. 

=== Minor Features

==== Partial types
- Usually handled by code generators
- Different parts can have different interfaces
- Partial methods and implicitly private and can have hooks for extra behavior
- But aren't included if never used
- Might help with testing

==== Static classes
- No instance methods, properties, events or constructors
- Signals intent
- Shouldn't be able to instantiate classes

==== Separate getter/setter access
- Improves encapsulation
- I'm realizing I have no idea what a getter and setter do? I know we need them, but whyyyy?
- Behind the scenes makes private fields on the assignment
- Can't be accessed directly except from the class

==== Namespace alias
- Helps remove ambiguity
- Use ::
- Sometimes it's easier to use when dealing with Datetime implementations

==== Pragma directives
- Give extra information to the compiler
- Can turn errors into warnings instead of blowing up compiler?

==== Fixed-size buffers
- Can only be used in unsafe code and within struct using ```fixed```

==== InternalsVisibleTo
- Assembly level attribute with single param with other assembly
- Allowing test assembly access to internal members for easier testing
- Tools can access internal members to avoid code duplication

== Chapter 3: LINQ and everything else

=== Automatically Implemented properties
- It's easier to set properties because of the automatic getters and setters (which we talked about last bookclub)
- Reduces boiler plate code

=== Implicit Typing

==== Typing Terminology
. Static and Dynamic Typing
- Statically typed usually are in compiled languages
- Dynamically typed leave everything to execution
- Binding happens at compile time
. Explicit and Implicit typing
- Explicit - source code specifies all the types involved
- Implicit - dev leaves out types from code, either compiler or execution determines the type
- C# is explicitly typed mostly

==== Implicitly typed local variables
- var
- Type inferred by compiler
- Explicit declaration is feasible and readable
- Type cant be named is anon
- Type of variable has long name can be inferred by human
- Can make declaration easier

==== Implicitly typed arrays
- Find candidate types
- Check whether every array element has implicit conversion to type
- One type left is inferred element type

=== Object collection and initializers
- Easy to create new objects

==== Intro to object and collection init
- Add constructors to initialize properties
- You don't always control the code for the classes being used
- Object and collection make create and populate objects easier

==== Object init
- Can only be used as part of constructor
- Specify arguments
- Says how to init each of the properties it mentions

==== Collection init
- Comma separated list in brackets
- Part of constructor
- .Add() method can add to collection
- Use bracket syntax for creation

==== Benefits of single expression init
. Init new objects in single expression can:
- simplify field initializers
- method arguments
- operands ?:
. Allows more concise code to create instance and populate

=== Anon types
- Allow building objects that in a static way without declaration

==== Syntax and basic behavior
- Using var because type has no name
- Still statically typed

- Use when the shape of the data doesn't matter outside of the scope
- Projection initializer allows for anon type to be created
- Reduces duplication of code

==== Compiler-generated type
- It's a class
- Its based of the ```object```
- It's sealed
- Props are read only
- Constructor props have same names as props
- It overrides gethashcode() and equals()
- It overrides GetString() to list prop names and values
- Type is generic with one type param per prop
- If two anon objects have some prop names, they are probably going to be two objects of same type

==== Limitations
- Localization : don't use an anon type across methods
- NO ENCAPSULATION
- It's awkward to use with a framework like MVC         

=== Lambda Expressions
- Makes code more concise
- From lambda calculus

==== Expression syntax
- ```param-list => body```
- Has exactly one param

==== Capturing variables
- Compiler converts the lambda to a method somewhere
- Declared outside of the lambda context
- No variables captured = create static method
- If variables captured in instance fields, instance method is created
- If local variables or params are captured, private nested class is created

==== Expression trees
- Code as data
- String representation is constructed from expression tree   

=== Extension Methods
- Simplest transformations of c# compiler

==== Declaring extension methods
- ```this``` keyword

==== Invoking extension method
- Compiler will want the regular method over the extension
- Works from deepest namespace to the global
- Extensions can be called on null values

==== Chaining method calls
- Lazy streaming-where-possible
- Calls methods in a sequence
- Order of operations

=== Query Expressions
- Translated to nonquery for the compiler and compiled as normal

==== Translate from c# to c#
- Syntatic translation that happens before overload resolution or binding
- Language has no specific expectations on the calls to extension methods

==== Range variables and transparent identifiers
- Initial from clause has the range variable
- ```let``` intros the variables
- Transparent identifier is a variable you don't see it when the query is written

==== Deciding when to use with syntax for LINQ
- From -> select -> group
- Method syntax, dot syntax, fluent syntax, lambda syntax
- Do what feels right?

=== LINQ
- Anonymous types
- Implicit typing in var
- Query expressions
- Lambda expressions
- Expression trees
- Makes it easier to sort stuff

== Chapter 4:   Improving interoperability

=== Dynamic Typing
- Looks simple, but is actually not

==== Intro
- looking up the meaning of a name in a certain content is binding
- There is no system.type
- implicit conversion from nonpointer type to dynamic
- implicit conversion from expression from type dynamic to nonpointer type
- expressions that involve a value type dynamic bound at execution
- value type dynamic has compile time type dynamic
- Only dynamic values are considered dynamically

==== Dynamic behavior beyond reflection
. Imaginary Example of Database Access
- database class responds to books in a table called same and returns an object
- search by author would search by on author column, generate SQL
- each row would respond to a title property by returning title
- ORM this is entity framework
- Is entity framework just dynamics?!
. ExpandoObject
. Dynamic view of JSON.net
- Handling json with a library is like a jobject, jarray, jproperty
- use LINQ on it, it works?
- Nested objects
. Implementing dynamic behavior
- Its complicated
- Represents the dynamic binding and binding logic of an object participating in the dynamic binding
- create a class from dynamicmetaobject and override?
- invoking any method prints message to console
- fetching property returns property name 

==== Look behind the scenes
. who what?
- c# compiler: implicit typing
- clr
- framework libraries: implementation of LINQ to use
. IL generated for dynamic typing
- Lots of call sites are involved
- cache within call site improve performance

==== Limitations and surprises
- A type can't specify that it implements an interface using dynamic anywhere in a type argument
- you cant' use dynamic anywhere in type constraints
- Can specify a base class that uses dynamic in type argument
- You can use dynamic interface type argument for var
. Extension methods
- execution time binder doesn't resolve
. Anon function
- can't be assigned to variable of type dynamic
- cast it to an intermediate static type
- lambda expressions can't appear dynamically
- converted lambdas can't contain dynamic operations
. Anon types
- treated as regular classes
- read props of instance of anon types, but only if code has access to generated class
. explicit interface implementation
- execution time binder uses execution time type

==== Usage suggestions
- Static typing makes errors show up earlier

=== Operational parameters and named arguments

==== Parameters with default values and arguments with names
- default value for param
- optional
- argument without name == positional argument
- default must be compile-time constraint

==== Determining the meaning of a method call
- positional before named
- named arguments match name
- param can have only one arg
- every required param must have arg with value
- optional params are permitted without arg

==== Impact on versioning
. Param name changes are breaking
. default values changes are at least surpising
. adding overloads is fiddly
. 

=== COM interoperability improvements
- Component interoperability improvements
- Cross language interoperability 

==== Linking primary interop assemblies
- Primary interop assembly
- type library importer tool
- link vs reference
- When PIA is linked - dynamic instead of object
- I have no idea

==== Optional parameters in COM
- (Most) everything is a ref parameter
- I have less idea than before

==== Named indexers
- Indexers are usually never named in source code

=== Generic variance

==== Simple examples in action
- Is any list of strings a list of objects? NOPE
- Covariance occurs when values are returned only as output
- Contravariance occurs when values are accepted only as input
- Invariance occurs when values are used as input and output

==== Syntax for variance
- Classes and structs cannot be covariant
- type param with out is covariant
- type param with in is contravariant
- type param with no mod is invariant

==== Restrictions
- Not inherited by class
- Conversion with variance => variance conversion
- an example of reference conversion
- only changes at compile time

==== In practice
-
