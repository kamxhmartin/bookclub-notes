= C# In Depth

== Chapter 1: Survival of the Sharpest

=== An evolving language
. Type System:
- Statically typed
- Better for scale
- Generics are pretty cool
. Concise Code:
- Construction and initialization
- Object and collection
. String handling
- nameOf
- interpolated string literals
. Data Access and LINQ
- Data transformations with functional thinking
. Asynch
. Efficiency and complexity
- CLR is much better than JIT
- Performance is better
. Speed of evolution
- Minor versioning makes getting fixes and new features faster

=== An evolving platform
. Expansive platform
. Developer friendly
. Unity for game development

=== Community
- Enterprise -> Community
- You can run C# anywhere

=== Book
. Mixed level coverage
- Books are harder to update than a language
. Noda Time https://github.com/nodatime/nodatime
. Terminology choices

== Chapter 2: C# 2

=== Generics

==== Collections before generics
- Arrays: Statically typed
- Object-based collections: Statically typed
- Specialized collections
- Need to know size before adding values

==== Generics save the day
. List<T> 
- Doesn't need to know size
- Uses t types
- Use with any element type without worrying about generating code and managing result
. Arity of Generic Types
- Declaration is the number of type parameters

==== What can be generic
- Fields
- Properties
- Indexers
- Constructors
- Events
- Finalizers

==== Type inference for type arguments to methods
- Tuples allow type inference to be used where stype arguments have to be explicit
- Type inference intersects with iheritance, conversions, option params
- Sometimes it works perfectly
- Sometimes you need to create a new generic to make it work
- If it fails at compile time sometimes you can fix it with a cast
- Or explicitly tell it

==== Type constraints
- Using iformattable as the base and inherit a generic type from it?
- By using inheritance, you can make the methods on the base class useable

==== Default and typeof operators
. default = default for type
- Reference types - null reference
- non-nullable types - all zeroes (0, 0.0, false, UTF-16 numeral 0)
- Nullable value types = null
. typeOf = 
- no generics involved (typeof(string))
- generics involved but not type params (typeof(list<int>))
- type param (typeof(T)) = closed constructed type
- Type param in operand (typeof(List<TItem>))
- no type param (typeof(List<>))
- Lots of methods and properties in type
- typeof(T) has same result as typeof(string)

==== Generic type initialization and state
- If you don't have a static type contructor, there are fewer timer guerentees
- different generic types are independent on init

=== Nullable Value Types


=== Simplified Delegate Creation

=== Iterators

=== Minor Features
